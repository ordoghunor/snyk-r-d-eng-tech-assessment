# Common Data Structures and Web Concepts

## 1. Explain the difference between a stack and a queue. Provide real life examples of real-life scenarios where each of them are used appropriately.

**Stack:**

- A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
- **Real-life Example:** A stack of plates in a cafeteria, where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be taken off.

**Queue:**

- A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
- **Real-life Example:** A queue of people waiting in line at a ticket counter, where the person who arrived first will be served first.

## 2. What is the difference between an array and a linked list? Provide advantages and disadvantages of each data structure.

**Array:**

- An array is a sequential collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Advantages:** Constant time access to elements using indices, suitable for small datasets.
- **Disadvantages:** Fixed size, expensive insertion and deletion operations in the middle.

**Linked List:**

- A linked list is a collection of elements, each connected to the next through pointers or references.
- **Advantages:** Dynamic size, efficient insertion and deletion operations anywhere in the list.
- **Disadvantages:** No constant time access to elements, requires extra memory for pointers.

## 3. What is HTTP? How is it different from HTTPS?

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**

- HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the World Wide Web.

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**

- HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts the data being transferred, providing a secure connection between the client and the server.

## 4. Can you give some examples of common HTTP response codes?

- **200 OK:** Request succeeded.
- **404 Not Found:** Resource with specified id does not exist, or the URL path is bad.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Server encountered an unexpected condition. It can mean a disaster for the company if it happens in a production environment.
- **301 Moved Permanently:** Resource has been moved permanently to a different location.
- **304 Not modified:** Resource has not been modified, so the cached version locally at the client can be reused.

## 5. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

**Authentication:**

- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

**Authorization:**

- Authorization is the process of determining if a user has the necessary permissions to access certain resources or perform certain actions.

## 6. How would you explain to a 5-year-old how the WWW works?

Think of the World Wide Web as a huge library filled with books. Each book is like a webpage, and each webpage has its own special address, just as each book has its own shelf number. When you want to read a book, you ask the librarian (your computer) to find it for you by giving the shelf number (web address). The librarian will then bring the book to you and you can read it. Similarly, if you want to see a webpage, you type its address into your computer and it fetches the webpage for you to see.
